Our veriﬁed bit blasting algorithm supports the full QF BV logic of SMT-LIB; it is speciﬁed and formally veriﬁed in the proof assistant Coq. We compare CoqQFBV with CVC4, Bitwuzla, and Boolector on benchmarks from the QF BV division of the single query track in the 2020 SMT Competition, and real-world cryptographic program veriﬁcation problems. CoqQFBV surprisingly solves more program veriﬁcation problems with certiﬁcation than the 2020 SMT QF BV division winner Bitwuzla without certiﬁcation.","tags":[],"title":"CoqQFBV: A Scalable Certiﬁed SMT Quantiﬁer-Free Bit-Vector Solver","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu-Fu Fu","Jiaxiang Liu","Xiaomu Shi","Ming-Hsien Tsai","Bow-Yaw Wang","Bo-Yin Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1573479893,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573479893,"objectID":"c117f2e1b207481dd568127f26fab93a","permalink":"https://yfu.tw/publication/ccs19-signed-cryptoline-gcc/","publishdate":"2019-10-11T21:44:53+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ccs19-signed-cryptoline-gcc/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop an automated formal technique to specify and verify signed computation in cryptographic programs. In addition to new instructions, we introduce a type system to detect type errors in programs. A type inference algorithm is also provided to deduce types and instruction variants in cryptographic programs. In order to verify signed cryptographic C programs, we develop a translator from the GCC intermediate representation to our language. Using our technique, we have verified 82 C functions in cryptography libraries including NaCl, wolfSSL, bitcoin, OpenSSL, and BoringSSL.","tags":[],"title":"Signed Cryptographic Program Verification with Typed CryptoLine","type":"publication"}]
